/********************************************************************

 The bits-io module is used to encode bits into an output file, and decode
 them from an input file. The bits-io module buffers output/input bits into an
 internal byte-sized buffer using a counter to know when to write or read a
 full byte to the output or input file. Here are the details:

 WRITING BITS

   Because we are using the stdio function fputc to write a byte to an output
   file we are required by its interface to deal with bytes, not bits, when
   writing.  That is, it is not possible to write a single bit to an output
   file in Unix - so, we must buffer the bits that we ultimately want to write
   to the output file into a byte. When the byte is full we can then write it
   to the output file.

   To do this correctly, we count the number of bits that can still be
   filled.  We insert new bits, working from the most significant to least
   significant bit.  When a byte is full, we write it and start over with
   an empty (zero) byte.

 READING BITS

   Because we are using the stdio function fgetc to read bytes from an input
   file, we are required by its interface to deal with bytes and not bits when
   reading (as for writing). Thus, we also count how many bits we have left
   to return from a given byte, and read the next byte only when necessary.
   Because at a higher level we track the number of uncompressed items we
   wrote to the file originally, and on reading we count that down, we
   should never encounter end of file when reading data back - we should
   read exactly the right number of bytes.  However, you should *check*
   that you do not read past the end of the file.  For this reason, fgetc
   return an int, not a char, and you should check for a -1 return value
   from fgetc, which indicates EOF (end of file).
