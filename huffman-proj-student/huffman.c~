/********************************************************************
 
 This represents the main Huffman coding algorithm. The algorithm operates in
 three phases:

 (1) Compute Frequencies 

       This phase works by reading each character from the input and updating
       its frequency in a table of Frequency objects (see tree.h).

 (2) TreeNode Creation

       After the frequency of each character in the input have been found we
       create a new TreeNode object for each character and add it to a
       priority queue. These initial TreeNode objects do not have child
       nodes. We figure out the children in part (3).

 (3) Huffman Tree Construction
      
       The third phase dequeues TreeNode objects from the priority queue until
       the priority queue contains only a single TreeNode object - this
       represents the root of the tree. With each iteration we dequeue the
       next two TreeNode objects L and R, create a new internal TreeNode X
       with its frequency being the addition of the two TreeNode objects we
       dequeued. We then assign the left child of X to be L and right child of
       X to be R. We then enqueue X into the priority queue.
